Fuzzy Logic Controller
======================

This was an assignment i wrote for my "Machine Learning, Expert Systems and Fuzzy Logic" course at the University of Malta.

For this assignment, we were required to design and implement a simple fuzzy logic controller that would be able to keep the pressure of a boiler at a set point by using test cases to evaluate its performance. Fuzzy logic controllers are good for such systems because they use analog inputs instead of binary, which allows for a smoother and more refined control over how the pressure changes over time [3].
The application was implemented using Microsoft’s .NET framework due to its rich library and broad support of different technologies, while the programming language used was C# due to its object oriented nature and ease of use. In order to produce a rich, well defined user interface, WPF was used due to its MVC paradigm and broad range of tools [1]. All the charts in the application were drawn using the WPF Charting Toolkit which is available from Microsoft’s Developer Network [2].
