Fuzzy Logic Controller
======================

This was an assignment i wrote for my "Machine Learning, Expert Systems and Fuzzy Logic" course at the University of Malta.

The application simulates a typical boiler which starts from some set pressure and increases the pressure to some ideal value with the use of a Fuzzy Logic Controller.

The beauty of using a Fuzzy Logic Controller means that unlike typical "saw-tooth" systems, pressure will remain very close to some ideal value.
